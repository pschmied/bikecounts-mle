@article{Niemeier96,
	Abstract = {This research examines composition, weather, and time-of-year count variability for a longitudinal bicycle count program. The results indicate greater variability in the PM peak period than in the AM peak period, and this variability is at least partially attributable to the presence of nonutility cyclists. Second, all locations display the same functional form for count volume by both temperature and amount of precipitation, and it appears that temperature may be a better predictor of volume than the amount of precipitation for these data. Third, the results of a Poisson model statistically confirm many of the factors thought to influence cyclists, and identify that a single count volume may be biased by as much as +/-15\% depending on the time of year in which the count was undertaken. Finally, a new bicycle functional classification system based on PM peak-period composition is proposed.   <p>Language: en</p>},

@article{Nosal12,
	Abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the impact of weather on the use of urban bicycle facilities in Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver and Portland, as well as on the Green Route in Quebec. This research makes use of long-term hourly and daily counts collected automatically using inductive loop detectors. The count data locations are organized into two groups -- utilitarian and recreational. Using regression models with autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) errors, the direct impact and lagged effects of weather variables on hourly and daily bicycle counts are investigated. Among the main findings, temperature and humidity are positively and negatively associated with cycling, respectively, with a non-linear association in most cases. Precipitation has a significant negative impact on cycling flows, and its effect was observed to increase with rain intensity. Lagged effects of rain were also observed, such as the effect of rain in the previous three hours, rain in the morning only, and rain in the afternoon only. Furthermore, urban bicycle flows are more sensitive to weather on weekends than on weekdays, and recreational facilities are more sensitive than utilitarian facilities. },

@article{Helbich14,
	Abstract = {Abstract With its sustainability, health and accessibility benefits, cycling has nowadays been established on research and policy agendas. Notwithstanding the decision to cycle is closely related to local weather conditions and interwoven with the geographical context, research dealing with both aspects is scarce. On the basis of travel diary data, we assess the association of three weather conditions, namely air temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, on cycling trips for leisure and commute purposes for the Greater Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Besides region-wide logit models and autologistic regressions, place-specific associations of weather conditions are explored through geographically weighted logit models. Considering the entire Rotterdam area, results confirm significant weather effects on cycling while highlighting the necessity to model the residents' locational component. When the confounding effects of individual and household characteristics are controlled, a key finding is that weather effects appear to vary across space, specifically between the more densely settled central environments and the surrounding lower-density areas. Additionally, the results show differences between leisure and commute trips, in which leisure trips appear to be more weather sensitive and show more pronounced spatial patterns. },
